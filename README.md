# Multi-Step-Form Project
This project can be used to search and store books on different shelves, depending on the books you have read, the ones you are currently reading, and the ones you want to read.
The link to the hosted version is: [chinonso-myreads-app](https://chinonso-myreads-app.netlify.app).

## Purpose
This App was built as an assessment.

## Installation
The project uses Node.js and the create-react-app starter. If you do not have Node installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to stave the project and run the following commands

```
git clone https://github.com/ChinonsoIg/multi-step-form.git

npm install
```
The above commands will clone the project into your local machine and install all the dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, launch the app by running the command:

```
npm start
```
A new browser tab should automatically open displaying the app. However, if this doesn't happen, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the project live in the development mode.

## How to Use the App
The homepage displays an intro. Click on the button "Apply for loan" to start your loan application.\
The application process has six steps. A step indicator shows steps that are completed.\
After completion, a summary of the application is displayed for preview before submission. The user can go back to previous sections.\
