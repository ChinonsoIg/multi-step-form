# Multi-Step-Form Project
This project is built with react and pure CSS.
The link to the hosted version is: [chinonso-multi-step-form
](https://chinonso-multi-step-form.netlify.app).

## Purpose
This App was built as an assessment.

## Installation
The project uses Node.js and the create-react-app starter. If you do not have Node installed, you can download it here: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Once Node is installed, navigate to the directory where you want to stave the project and run the following commands

```
git clone https://github.com/ChinonsoIg/multi-step-form.git

npm install
```
The above commands will clone the project into your local machine and install all the dependencies.

Once the dependencies are installed, launch the app by running the command:

```
npm start
```
A new browser tab should automatically open displaying the app. However, if this doesn't happen, navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the project live in the development mode.

## How to Use the App
The homepage displays an intro. Click on the button "Apply for loan" to start your loan application.\
The application process has six steps. A step indicator shows the steps (both the completed steps and the pending steps).\
After completion, a summary of the application is displayed for preview before submission. The user can go back to previous steps to edit the data before submission.\
